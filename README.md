# Reddit Adblock Test

A small Chrome extension that removes promoted cards on new web Reddit using the classic layout.

Will most likely stop working when reddit tweaks the UI but I wanted to see what making an extension is like.

Uses the default icons from the Chrome Extensions Reading Time Tutorial.
